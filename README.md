### About me:
I’m a software engineer with a focus on data pipelines, automation, and clean architecture. For me, good engineering is about clarity: systems should be simple, scalable, and resilient—not overengineered.

I like dealing with messy, real-world data: ingesting it, transforming it, and shaping it into reliable flows that people can actually trust. My goal isn’t just to make things work once, but to build tools that keep working long after the first deployment.

I value three things above all:

Simplicity – the cleanest solution is usually the most sustainable.
Patterns over chaos – design patterns avoid fragile, confusing code.
No repetition – logic should exist in one place and be done right.

At the end of the day, I don’t think of my work as just writing scripts. 
I think of it as building tools that free people from repetitive tasks and make data more useful.
